<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specialty Fiber Optics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multimode Fiber</li><li>Singlemode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The specialty fiber optics market is primarily divided into two types: multimode fiber and singlemode fiber. Multimode fiber features a larger core diameter, allowing multiple light modes to propagate simultaneously, making it suitable for short-distance data transmission, like within buildings. In contrast, singlemode fiber has a smaller core, enabling only one light mode to travel, which enhances signal clarity and extends transmission distances, ideal for telecommunications and long-haul applications. Both types serve critical roles in modern communication networks.</p></p>
