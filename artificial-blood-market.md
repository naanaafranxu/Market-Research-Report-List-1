<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Blood Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Human Blood</li><li>Synthetic Blood</li><li>Animal Blood</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial blood market comprises three main types: human blood, synthetic blood, and animal blood. Human blood, often sourced from blood banks, is crucial for transfusions but limited by donor availability. Synthetic blood, developed to mimic the oxygen-carrying functions of natural blood, offers a viable alternative to alleviate shortages and reduce transfusion risks. Animal blood, primarily derived from veterinary sources, is less common but can be used in specific medical applications. Each type serves unique needs within the healthcare system.</p></p>
